`./data/shared/meta` contains tables used infuse raw data with meta-information (e.g. names and properties of variables, grouping rules, (re)naming conventions, etc.)

Study-specific meta-data should be placed into a respective subfolder.

See the contents of each sub-folders in the list of [contents.md](../../contents.md).
