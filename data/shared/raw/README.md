`./data/shared/raw` Directory
=========
In this directory, place the 'raw' files that come from the researcher/client.  Do not change anything in raw files; make these changes programmatically.  Request that updates/refreshes to this file strictly follow the same schema, so downstream code doesn't require changes.

Files in this directory are stored locally AND ARE staged/committed and sent to the central GitHub repository.  For more information, see `./data/README.md`

See the contents of each sub-folders in the list of [contents.md](../../contents.md).
