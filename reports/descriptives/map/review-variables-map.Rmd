In this report we review the variables in the Memory and Aging Project (MAP) study of RUSH Institute.

# (I) Exposition

This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by sequence of scripts  

- `./manipulation/map/0-greeter-map.R`   
- `./manipulation/map/1-tuner-map.R`   
- `./manipulation/map/2-encoder-map.R`   
- `./manipulation/map/3-validator-map.R`   

Their roles are described in the following chain of custody:

<img src="../../../libs/images/support/chain-of-custody-map.jpg" width="900px" /> 


## Overview of objects  

Let us review the data objects in this chain of custody. We will mostly use the `dto$valid` dataset, as the one containing all (and only) necessary variable for our modeling exercise and only those cases/subjects that were considered eligible from the data quality perspective. 

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->
```{r load-data, echo=T, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

## Meta

The `dto` contains the meta data set, descrdibing the existing variables. This spreadsheet is the means by which variables are studied, classified, described, and annotated.  The process of applying this meta data file to alter the `raw` form is described in the `./manipulation/map/0-greeter-map.R` script.

```{r meta-table, echo=FALSE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

## How to interact

Now that the full chain of custody is loaded into our analytic environment, we can demonstrate some of the ways we can interact with `dto` to set the stage for data visualization to follow. 
<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->
```{r inspect-data-1, echo=T, results='show', message=FALSE, eval=F}
```

## A few basic Qs

> What is the difference between `dto$valid` and `ds_estimation`? 

If all elibible cases (from perspective of data cleanliness) are employed during estimation, these two data sets should have the same cases.

```{r inspect-data-2, echo=T, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

## Contents 

To be explicit about the content of the focal data set for this report, we list its geneology and local transformations in the following call. 
<!-- Tweak the datasets.   -->
```{r tweak-data, echo=T, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

Now that the `valid` data set is loaded up into our environment and we understand its relationship to `ds_estimation` we can look at what data displays for individual cases.  
```{r inspect-data-3, echo=T, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Basic table view.   -->
```{r basic-table, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Basic graph view.   -->
```{r basic-graph, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

# (II) - Development

# Age

```{r age-1, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE, eval=T}
```


# Education
```{r B-4-education, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE, eval=T}
```

# BMI
```{r B-6-bmi, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE, eval=T}
```

# Cognition

Let us review variables related to cognitive health.

## Global cognition
```{r B-2-cognitive-5-cogn_global, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE, eval=T}
```

## Dementia
```{r B-3-dementia-diagnosis, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE, eval=T}
```

## MMSE
```{r B-2-cognitive-5-mmse, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE, eval=T}
```

# Gait
```{r gait-1, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE, eval=T}
```
